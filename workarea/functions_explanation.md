# Functions: Declaring and Calling - Function Types

## What are Functions?

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They're fundamental building blocks in JavaScript programming.

## Declaring and Calling

**Declaring** means creating a function with a name and instructions. **Calling** means executing that function to run its instructions.

## Function Types

JavaScript has three main types: **function declarations** (traditional named functions), **function expressions** (functions stored in variables), and **arrow functions** (modern shorthand syntax). Each serves the same purpose but with different syntax styles.
